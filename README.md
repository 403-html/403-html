Hi, I'm Tymoteusz! I really love testing and coding. I care a lot about making software that works well for people.

## About Me

- I work in QA and enjoy automation. I like finding bugs, but I enjoy building systems that catch bugs even more.

- I'm always looking for ways to make work flow better and run smoother.

- I never stop learning new things.

- And yes, I run on sweets - especially bajaderka, which is my absolute weakness.
