I'm Tymoteusz, and I'm not just passionate about testing, coding â€“ I'm obsessed with crafting high-quality software experiences. My journey in QA has been fueled by a love for automation and a fascination with optimizing the flow of processes.

## Get to Know Me

- I'm QA, automation enthusiast. I don't just find bugs; I build systems to hunt them down. Think of me as a digital detective for software quality.
- I love streamlining workflows and making sure everything runs smoothly. Efficiency is my middle name (not really, but you get the idea).
- Always learning, always growing.
- Fueled by a constant supply of sweets, especially bajaderka â€“ my kryptonite.
